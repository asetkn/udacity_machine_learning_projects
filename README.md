# Projects completed for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

## Projects

### capstone_project
Train a Transfer Learning model on top of VGG19. The model needs to identify a correct dog breed from a a picture. Model was trained on 133 breeds.

### boston_housing
Find the best regression model parameters using grid search to predict Boston Housing Prices.

### finding_donors
Supervised prediction model training. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 

### customer_segments
Unsupervised client clustering project. The goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. 

### dog_project
The dog breed image classification project. Train a Transfer Learning model on top of VGG19. The model needs to identify a correct dog breed from a picture. Model was trained on 133 breeds.
