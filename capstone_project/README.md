# The capstone project for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. 

## Objective
To assess the impact of climate change on Earth's flora and fauna, it is vital to quantify how
human activities such as logging, mining, and agriculture are impacting our protected natural
areas. Researchers in Mexico have created the VIGIA project, which aims to build a system for
autonomous surveillance of protected areas. A first step in such an effort is the ability to
recognize the vegetation inside the protected areas.
We have pictures of plants from Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley. We need to identify which pictures
contain columnar cactus (Neobuxbaumia tetetzo). This is a binary image classification problem.
